'''
Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn
containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls.
Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes.
'''

* Total no. of balls in the urn is 4+6=10
* Out of 10, there are 4 red balls and 6 black balls

If we draw one ball at each random succession, then all possible events could be:

1. Both red
2. Red then Black
3. Black then red
4. Both Black

If we pick one ball, then in 2nd trial, there will be 9 balls in the urn as we are not replacing the ball 
which was picked at first event.

so 
1. The probability of both Red (RR) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 0.13332
2. The probability of first Red and second Black (RB) = (4/10) * (6/9) = 0.2666
3. The probability of first Black and second Red (BR) = (6/10) * (4/9) = 0.2666
4. The probability of both Black (BB) = (6/10) * (5/9) = 0.3333

Now we can say that :
probability of both Red(RR) is 0.13332
probability of either Red or Black(RB or BR) is 0.2666+0.2666 = 0.5332
probability of both Black(BB) is 0.3333
